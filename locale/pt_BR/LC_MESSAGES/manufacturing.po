msgid "A product using a Kit BoM will appear as a single line item on a quotation and sales order, but will generate a delivery order with one line item for each of the components of the kit. In the examples below, the image at left shows a sales order for the kit \"Custom Computer Kit\", while the image at right shows the corresponding delivery order."

msgid "A subassembly is a manufactured product which is intended to be used as a component of another manufactured product. You may wish to employ sub-assemblies to simplify a complex BoM, to more accurately represent your manufacturing flow, or to use the same subassembly in multiple BoMs. A BoM that employs subassemblies is often referred to as a multi-level BoM."

msgid "When manufacturing with routings and work orders, each work order is scheduled individually. You will also have access to time and capacity planning, and reports on costing and efficiency on a work center level."

msgid "A bill of materials (BoM) is a document that describes the component products, the quantity of each component, and the process required to manufacture a product, including a routing and individual steps."
msgstr ""

msgid "From the **Products** menu in either the Inventory or Manufacturing app, create each component product as you would any other product, then create the top-level, or kit product. The kit product should have only the route **Manufacture** set. Because you cannot track the stock of kit products, the Product Type should be set to **Consumable**. Because a kit product cannot be purchased, **Can be Purchased** should be unchecked."

msgstr ""

msgid "You will most likely use manufacturing orders without routings if all the work to produce your product is performed in one place, by one person, in one step, and/or you do not need the level of granular control afforded by work orders and routings."

msgid "If you would like to manage stock of the top-level kit product, you will use a standard BoM with a manufacturing step instead of a Kit BoM.

msgid "Managing your operations in this way is the default behavior in Odoo. There are two basic phases from planning to production:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To add byproducts to a BoM, you will first need to enable them from :menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings`."
msgstr ""

msgid "On the product form of the subassembly, you must select the routes **Manufacture** and **Make To Order**. The **Manufacture** route takes precedence over the **Buy** route, so selecting the latter will have no effect."

msgid "Manage Stock of Component Products"

msgid "All other parameters on the kit product may be modified according to your preference. The component products require no special configuration."

msgstr ""

msgid "The workflow is thus divided into three basic phases, as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before creating your first bill of materials, you will need to create a product and at least one component (components are considered products in Odoo). You can do so from :menuselection:`Master Data --> Products`, or on the fly from the relevant fields on the BoM form. Review the Inventory chapter for more information about configuring products. Once you have created a product and at least one component, select them from the relevant dropdown menus to add them to your bill of materials. A new bill of materials can be created from :menuselection:`Master Data --> Bills of Materials`, or using the button on the top of the product form."

msgid "If you would like to assemble kits as they are ordered, managing stock of the kit *components* only, you will use a Kit BoM without a manufacturing step."

msgid "If you unbuild a product you bought, you will get the components from the BoM back in stock."
msgstr ""

msgid "In Odoo, each product may have multiple BoMs associated with it, but a BoM can only be associated with a single product. A single BoM can, however, describe multiple variants of the same product."
msgstr ""

msgid "Under the **Miscellaneous** tab, you can fill additional fields. **Sequence** defines the order in which your BoMs will be selected for production orders, with lower numbers having higher priority. **Version** allows you to track changes to your BoM over time."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you would like to be able to purchase the subassembly in addition to manufacturing it, select **Can be Purchased**. All other fields on the subassembly product form may be configured according to your preference."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you choose to manage your manufacturing operations using manufacturing orders only, you will define basic bills of materials without routings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Multi-level bills of materials in Odoo are accomplished by creating a top-level BoM and subassembly BoMs. Next, the procurement route of the subassembly product is defined. This ensures that every time a manufacturing order for the top-level product is created, a manufacturing order for each subassembly is created as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "While in the Manufacturing App, under the *Operations* tab you will find the menu *Unbuild Orders*."
msgstr ""

msgid "When a customer sends you a product for repair, create a new *Repair Order*. Fill it in with all the information you may need such as the product, the customer, if it has to be invoiced after or before the repair, the parts you might need, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may define the work operation or step in which each component is consumed using the field, **Consumed in Operation** under the **Components** tab. Similarly, you can define the operation at which the product will be produced under the **Miscellaneous** tab using the field **Produced at Operation**. If this field is left blank, the products will be consumed/produced at the final operation in the routing."
msgstr ""

msgid "To use work orders and routings, you will need to enable the option **Manage production by work orders** From :menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings`. You will then be able to add routings to bills of materials, and configure some additional related fields. You will also be able to create **work centers**, the locations at which work orders are performed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manufacturing using routings can be broken down into several steps. When configuring your BoM, you will need to add a routing defining the component work orders. After planning the manufacturing order, you will have the added step of scheduling work orders."

There are two basic ways to configure kits, depending on how stock of the kit product is to be managed. In either case, both the Inventory and Manufacturing apps must be installed."
msgstr ""

msgid "A routing defines a series of operations required to manufacture a product and the work center at which each operation is performed. A routing may be added to multiple BoMs, though a BoM may only have one routing. For more information about configuring routings, review the chapter on routings."

msgid "Let's take the first case, you are manufacturing products yourself. If one of your product presents some defect, you might want to unbuild it instead of scrapping it completely, allowing you to reuse some components of the product."

msgid "There are two basic ways to manage manufacturing in Odoo. The first way manages work with one document only. This document is the **manufacturing order**. The second way uses additional documents to give you more precise control over the manufacturing process. In this way, **Manufacturing orders** are divided into one or more steps defined by **work orders**, performed in an order defined by **routings**."
