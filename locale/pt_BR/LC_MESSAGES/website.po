msgid "**Concatenated:** every module or library you might use in Odoo has its own set of CSS, Less or Sass files (eCommerce, blogs, themes, etc.). Having several CSS files is great for the modularity, but not good for the performance because most browsers can only perform 6 requests in parallel resulting in lots of files loaded in series. The latency time to transfer a file is usually much longer than the actual data transfer time, for small files like .JS and .CSS. Thus, the time to load CSS resources depends more on the number of requests to be done than the actual file size."
