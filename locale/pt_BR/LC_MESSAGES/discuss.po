That way you will receive incoming messages without delay. Indeed, Odoo Online is fetching incoming messages of external servers once per hour only. You should set redirections for all the email addresses to Odoo's domain name in your email server (e.g. *catchall@mydomain.ext* to *catchall@mycompany.odoo.com*)."
